            <h2 class="mb-4">Our History</h2>
            <p>
                Software Farm was founded in 1997, following the algamation of Properdata, established in 1981, and Tarragon Computing's agricultural software in 1996. This integration
                laid the foundation for the development of our reliable Windows-based software products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, we've focused on enhancing our products by combining the strengths and features of similar software products. For instance, SimFini was developed by
                integrating the functionality of Finvloei and AgriFin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our offices are located in Pretoria, where we oversee all business operations. The software products are marketed through a network of dealers spread across various 
                provinces in South Africa. Some of our larger dealers also offer bureau services to their clients using Software Farm products.
